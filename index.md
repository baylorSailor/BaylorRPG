## Welcome to the BaylorRPG Project Page

BaylorRPG is a text-based RPG currently in development that aims to be a fun, adventure text game set in the perspective of
a Baylor student's daily life complete with all the quirks and inside humor a typical undergrad may encounter. Expected features include character customization, a battle system, inventory and skills menu, and a story-based adventure based on real locations and people on Baylor's campus.

This site is where we collaborate to share updates, host files, and provide information for the status of our 
game as it is in development and beyond. [Code and relevant files can be viewed here](https://github.com/cameron1701/BaylorRPG.git)
